GLPy
++++

GLPy is a python module based on `PyOpenGL`_ that gives a nice, class-based
wrapper around common OpenGL functions. It aims to allow access (within reason)
to most native OpenGL functionality.

Installation
============

Installation via ``pip`` will soon be supported. Not yet though.

Requirements
------------

`PyOpenGL`_ and `NumPy`_ are required. `Sphinx`_ is required to build documentation.
